**Problem Statement**

You are given a list of votes for an election using the *Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)* system.

* Each voter provides a ranked list of candidates, ordered by preference.
* In each round:

  1. Only the **first preference** (index `0`) of each voter is counted.
  2. If any candidate gets **more than 50% of the total votes**, that candidate wins immediately.
  3. Otherwise, the candidate with the **minimum number of votes** is eliminated.

     * If multiple candidates have the same minimum votes, eliminate the candidate with the **smallest candidate ID**.
  4. Remove the eliminated candidate from **all ballots**.
  5. Repeat the process with the updated ballots until a winner is found.

Return the ID of the winning candidate.

    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [2, 1, 3],
      [3, 2, 1],
      [1, 3, 2]
    ]

**Output:**

* An integer representing the candidate ID who wins the election.

---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Count only the first element of each vote list.
2. Majority check:
   value > totalVotes / 2
3. Elimination:
   * Find minimum vote count.
   * If tie → eliminate the candidate with the smallest ID.
4. Ballot update:
   * Remove eliminated candidate from every vote list.
5. Continue indefinitely until a winner emerges.

**In one line:**

> Implement the Instant Runoff Voting algorithm to determine the winning candidate from a set of ranked ballots, repeatedly eliminating the lowest-voted candidate and redistributing votes until one candidate has a strict majority.
